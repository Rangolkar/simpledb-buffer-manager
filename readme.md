* LRUBufferManager.java
* ClockBufferManager.java
* LRUBuffer.java
* ClockBuffer.java

Source Files Modified:
* BasicBufferMgr.java
* Buffer.java
* SimpleDB.java
* Startup.java

Compile:
* Extract the zip file to get the project folder.
* Import this project folder into Eclipse.
* To start the server, run the class simpleDB.server.Startup.
  * Run this class with a run configuration, giving these arguments:

```
cs4432db -clock
```
  * To run LRU replacement policy:
```
cs4432db -lru
```
* To run the test queries file, run the class sql_client.src.main.test_simpledb_sql.java
  * Run this class with a run configuration, giving these arguments:
```
